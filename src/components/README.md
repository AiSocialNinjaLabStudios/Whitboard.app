# Interactive Guide to LLM Module Cloning

An interactive, visually-structured web application for exploring, comparing, and applying techniques for reusing pre-trained LLM (Large Language Model) modules—built for engineers, researchers, and applied AI professionals.

---

## Features

- **Tabbed, Single-Page App:** Quickly jump between Concepts, Methodologies, Frameworks, and Best Practices—no endless scrolling.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** 
  - Bar chart comparing trade-offs of Feature Extraction, Fine-Tuning, and PEFT (e.g., LoRA), with tooltips for fast insight.
- **Framework Cheat-Sheets:** 
  - Tabs for Hugging Face, TensorFlow/Keras, and PyTorch, each listing key functions for module cloning and reuse.
- **Best Practice Checklists & Use Cases:** 
  - Concrete guidance and real-world scenarios to guide LLM module reuse strategy.
- **Accessible, Modern Design:** 
  - Uses Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional UI. No SVG or Mermaid dependencies—pure HTML/CSS/JS.

## Why Module Cloning?

- **Efficiency:** Drastically reduces both compute time and cost.
- **Performance:** Leverages knowledge from large-scale pre-training for superior results, especially with limited data.
- **Flexibility:** Enables creation of smaller, specialized models for edge or resource-constrained use.

├── README.md         # This file
```

- **Concepts:** Understand why and when to reuse model modules.
- **Methodologies:** Compare core approaches (Feature Extraction, Fine-Tuning, PEFT).
- **Frameworks:** Quick-reference tabs for Hugging Face, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch.
- **In Practice:** Best practices, checklists, and common use cases.

## Quick Start

Just open `index.html` in your browser.  
No build step, no backend needed.

## Technologies Used

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- Vanilla JS (for tab switching and chart rendering)
- No SVG/Mermaid—All diagrams are built with HTML/CSS

---

## Extending & Editing

- All content and logic live in `index.html`.
- To add new frameworks, duplicate a framework tab and table section.
- For new methodologies, update the chart and corresponding descriptions.
