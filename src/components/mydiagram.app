# MyDiagramApp

## Overview

**MyDiagramApp** is a collaborative, AI-powered diagramming and mapping platform inspired by industry leaders, but built from the ground up with unique code, assets, and open extensibility in mind. It’s designed for teams and individuals to visually map, diagram, and prototype anything—from processes and architectures to brainstorming sessions.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Canvas:** Drag-and-drop, resize, align, and connect shapes with precision.
- **Shape Packs:** Basic shapes, connectors, flowcharts, plus advanced packs (BPMN, AWS, UML, ERD, more).
- **Custom Libraries:** Create and reuse your own shapes and templates.
- **AI Tools:** Generate diagrams from text, smart auto-layout, and apply themes using LLMs.
- **Swimlanes & Layers:** Organize complex diagrams for clarity.
- **Collaboration:** Real-time multi-user editing, comments, sticky notes, and sharing.
- **Export Options:** Save diagrams as PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF.
- **Keyboard & Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation and accessibility support.
- **Integrations:** (Planned) Embed boards, connect with project management tools.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** React (TS/JS) + Canvas/WebGL + Modern CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express, WebSockets, REST APIs, optional Python microservices for AI
- **AI:** OpenAI, Hugging Face transformers for text-to-diagram and diagram intelligence
- **Database:** MongoDB (or your choice)
- **Authentication:** JWT, OAuth, SSO support
